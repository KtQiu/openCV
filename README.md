# openCV
I began to write this repository in July 2017. In the class Introduction to AI, Prof. Xi Li hand out some tasks. 
My smart partner Cq Deng and I started from scratch and learned as we went.
The repository is  mainly about meaching learing.

Cause the condition of my PC, the lib opencv-python is nested,that way we must import it in a certain waylike that
'''
    import cv2 
    from cv2 import *
'''
